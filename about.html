				<p>I'm not normal kid from my childhood, you judged me right.. I'm <i>weird</i> guy</p>
				<p>I was unable to understand my surroundings and I always afraid from everything</p>
				<p>I was mentally lost person but from my luck I become normal like others now</p>
				<p>I always pray to God for my brain and be like normal person like others</p>
				<p>Now I'm more likely to be Normal person and hardly people can tell me I'm weird</p> 
				<p>That's my biggest insecurities of people judge me <i>idiot</i> or <i>brainless</i></p>

				<h4>Fear</h4> 
				<div id="fear"></div>
				<p><i>Fear</i> is my best friend in emotions becouse it never leaves me alone</p>
				<p>Because of fear I became <i>underconfidence</i> in people and can't express myself</p>
				<p>Fear of being idiot in many people and get <i>rejected</i> by humans that's why I'm introvert</p>
				<p>The most unluckiest thing of my fear is that from which I afraid that happens for sure</p> 
				<p>Although I have so much emotions in intense level like funny mood and angry mood</p> 
				<p>But the emotion of fear makes me week and because of it I look like weird guy</p>
